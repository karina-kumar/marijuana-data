## Setup

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(clipr)

```

## Import and Combine

We will use list.files(), map() and list_rbind() to import and combine our files in one fell swoop. 

First I am making a list of all my files from the data processed folder. 

```{r}
wx_files_list <- list.files(
  "data-processed",
  pattern = "\\.csv",
  full.names = TRUE
)

wx_files_list
```

Now I am going to combine all the files into one tibble using rbind.

```{r}
wx_all <- wx_files_list |> 
  set_names(basename) |> #what does this do?
  map(
  read_csv, 
  col_select = c(name, charges, address_arrest, age, race, sex, agency_arrest, date_arrest, ethnicity)
  )|> 
    list_rbind(names_to = "source") |> #names_to gives me a column with the source file so I can parse it later
    clean_names()

wx_all
```

Now I am going to break up the source column so I have a column with the city or county name and if it's a city or county.
